      "whyDescription": "I love going deep with people. The skin is not just a canvas for me, but a threshold â€“ between inside and outside, past and future. Every tattoo is a dialogue for me: What do you want to show? What do you want to connect to? I don't just tattoo, I accompany transformation."

I let myself be inspired by forms of nature as well as anatomy and symbolically use the eye as a source of power for presence. In a free, intuitive process I connect these elements with form-creating shading to visually work out clarity."

    "eye": {
      "title": "The Eye",
      "description": "The eye appears in many of my tattoos â€“ a symbol of mindfulness. It reminds us of the present moment, of the now â€“ that space where everything is one: steady, eternal, undivided. There is power in presence. My art is an invitation to remember â€“ every time your gaze touches the tattoo and pulls you back from the vortex of thoughts into being. A silent call to consciousness: You are here. You are whole."
